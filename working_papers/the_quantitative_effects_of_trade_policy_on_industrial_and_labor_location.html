              We evaluate the quantitative effects of trade policy on the
              location of firms across space and over time. We develop a
              multi-country, multi-sector dynamic general-equilibrium trade and
              spatial model with forward-looking decisions of workers on where
              to supply labor, forward-looking decisions of firms on where to
              locate produc-tion, endogenous capital structure accumulation, and
              trade in intermediate goods with sectoral linkages. We bring the
              model to data using trade, production, and data on firm
              demographics across sector and locations. We use the model to
              study if trade protectionism can revert the declining trend in the
              U.S. manufacturing em-ployment and firms; and its impact on the
              location of production across space and over time. We feed into
              the model the raise in import tariffs between the U.S. and its
              major trade partners in the year 2018. We find that these changes
              in trade policy can result in a persistent increase on
              manufacturing employment and firms. However, these effects do not
              revert the long run decline in manufacturing employment and firms.
              Importantly, the relocation of production comes at the cost of
              higher prices, lower welfare for households, and heterogeneous
              effects on firm entry across space.
