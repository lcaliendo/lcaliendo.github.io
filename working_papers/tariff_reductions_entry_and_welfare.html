              We use a multi-sector, heterogeneous-firm trade model to study the
              trade and welfare effects of commercial policy. We show that the
              effect of tariffs on entry, especially in the presence of
              production linkages, can reverse the traditional positive
              optimal-tariff argument. We then use a new tariff dataset, and
              apply it to a 189-country, 15-sector version of our model, to
              quantify the trade, entry, and welfare effects of trade
              liberalization over the period 1990â€“2010. We find that the impact
              on firm entry was larger in Advanced relative to Emerging and
              Developing countries; that more than 90% of the gains from trade
              are a consequence of the reductions in MFN tariffs (the Uruguay
              Round); and that for some countries, particularly some Emerging
              and Developing countries, there are additional gains from a
              further move to complete free trade. The countries gaining from
              the elimination of tariffs have a strong rank correlation with
              those that gain from a negative optimal tariff, which comprise
              one-quarter of the countries in the world.
