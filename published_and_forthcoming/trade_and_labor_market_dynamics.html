            <p>
              We develop a dynamic trade model with spatially distinct labor
              markets facing varying exposure to international trade. The model
              captures the role of labor mobility frictions, goods mobility
              frictions, geographic factors, and input-output linkages in
              determining equilibrium allocations. We show how to solve the
              equilibrium of the model and take the model to the data without
              assuming that the economy is at a steady state and without
              estimating productivities, migration frictions, or trade costs,
              which can be difficult to identify. We calibrate the model to 22
              sectors, 38 countries, and 50 U.S. states. We study how the rise
              in China's trade for the period 2000 to 2007 impacted U.S.
              households across more than a thousand U.S. labor markets
              distinguished by sector and state. We find that the China trade
              shock resulted in a reduction of about 0.55 million U.S.
              manufacturing jobs, about 16% of the observed decline in
              manufacturing employment from 2000 to 2007. The U.S. gains in the
              aggregate but, due to trade and migration frictions, the welfare
              and employment effects vary across U.S. labor markets. Estimated
              transition costs to the new long-run equilibrium are also
              heterogeneous and reflect the importance of accounting for labor
              dynamics.
