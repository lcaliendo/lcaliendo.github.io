              The economic effects from labor market integration are crucially
              affected by the extent to which countries are open to trade. In
              this paper we build a multi-country dynamic general equilibrium
              model to study and quantify the economic effects of trade and
              labor market integration of the 2004 European Union enlargement.
              In our model, trade is costly and households of different skills
              and nationalities face costly forward-looking relocation
              decisions. We use the EU Labour Force Survey to construct annual
              migration flows by employment status, skill, and nationality
              across EU countries for the period 2002-2014. We exploit the
              timing of the changes in policies due to the EU enlargement to
              identify the changes in migration costs. We apply our model and
              use these estimates, as well as the observed changes in tariffs,
              to quantify the effects from the enlargement. We find that new
              member state countries are the largest winners, with heterogenous
              effects across skill groups. We find smaller welfare gains for
              EU-15 countries. However, in the absence of changes to trade
              policy, the EU-15 would have been worse off after the enlargement.
              We study even further the interaction effects between trade and
              migration policies, the importance of the timing of migration
              policy, and the role of different mechanisms in shaping our
              results. Our results highlight the importance of trade for the
              quantification of the welfare and migration effects from labor
              market integration. We also use our framework to quantify the
              general equilibrium effects of imposing migration and trade
              restrictions due to Brexit.
