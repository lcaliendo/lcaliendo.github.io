            <p>
              Exporting affects the organization of production. In order to
              produce at the scale needed to access export markets, firms need
              to hire teams of workers with a different set of skills, pay them
              different wages and give them different roles within the
              organization. In this chapter we explore how a firmâ€™s organization
              reacts to new or improved export opportunities. Guided by the
              theory of knowledgebased hierarchies,1 we understand organization
              as the characteristics and roles played by the workers within a
              firm. Hence, we explore how the number of management layers, as
              well as the number of workers and wages in each of these layers,
              change when the firm starts exporting or expands its presence in
              foreign markets. Our goal is to document these relationships and
              attempt to rationalize them using available theories. Given that
              these reorganizations have important implications for the size,
              hiring practices and productivity of exporting firms, the findings
              are relevant to understand the overall effects of trade
              liberalizations, as demonstrated by Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg
              (2012, from now on CRH).
