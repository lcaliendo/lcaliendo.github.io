              This chapter reviews a recent body of theoretical and empirical
              work that studies the normative and positive aspects of trade
              policy. We start by presenting reduced-form evidence of the e↵ects
              of trade policy in the presence of supply linkages, on the
              short-run and persistent e↵ects of trade policy across local labor
              markets, and on the e↵ects of trade policy uncertainty on
              employment and firms. We describe the applications of the
              shift-share method to trade policy, discuss the interpretation of
              the estimated e↵ects, and provide a theoretical foundation and
              extensions. We then describe new quantitative frameworks, methods,
              and data used to study the aggregate and distributional e↵ects of
              trade policy in general equilibrium. We discuss how to take into
              account supply linkages, local labor markets, and different
              sources of dynamics. As an illustration, we quantify the aggregate
              and distributional e↵ects of the 2018 trade war between the United
              States and its trading partners. Finally, we present recent
              theoretical insights on optimal unilateral trade policy with firm
              and product heterogeneity in the context of large and small open
              economies with perfectly and imperfectly competitive product
              markets. We also discuss how optimal trade policy is shaped by the
              presence of multiple sectors, intermediate goods, and supply
              linkages. We close the chapter by discussing the scope of future
              research and highlighting the need to better connect the
              empirical, quantitative, and theoretical findings in recent trade
              policy literature.
